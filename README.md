# EPLplayer_data(2018-2023season)

These files contain player data from the last five seasons of the Premier League, including gls, ast, shot, passing and other data sets. All data comes from this website: https://fbref.com/en/

I've added the csv and json files for ease of use without the additional page scraping. This data set can be used for machine learning model training, predicting player influence, generating ratings, etc.

Hope you like it.
